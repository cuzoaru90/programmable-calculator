# The Programmable Calculator

This program reflects my capabilites as a programmer during my final semester of university (Fall 2013). At this point, I believed that I was truly becoming comfortable with the C++ language and OOP in general. 

The code is excessively long, but it is still very readable and nicely documented. I spent a lot of time and effort on the program, so I am proud of it in these respects. However, I can see how often this violates DRY principles. 

I've grown quite a lot ever since, and I am grateful to have this as a snapshot.
